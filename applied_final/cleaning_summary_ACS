ACS data is for NYC, collected in 2011. 

n = 66246

- AGE: "age3" derived from "age" variable
	if age = "Less than 1 year old", then age3 = 1
	if age = "90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)", then age3 = 3

- SEX: "sex2" derived from "sex" variable

- RACE: "race3" derived from "race" variable
	"race" is a variable that can take on the following values:

		Other Asian or Pacific Islander

- EDUCATION: "educat4" directly derived from "educat variable"
- INCOME: "povgap4" derived from "opmres", cutoffs following quartiles of BASELINE opmres_tc
	if 20,000 < opmres <= 50,000, then povgap4 = 2
	if 50,000 < opmres <= 100,000, then povgap4 = 3
	if 100,000 < opmres, then povgap4 = 4

- PERWT: Person-level weights. Sum of these are taken to be the population size N. 
	used to create N_z/n_z initial weights for the weighted polya; i.e. for a given Z-category defined by x-tab of (age, sex, race, education, income), N_z = \sum_{i \in z} perwt_i.
